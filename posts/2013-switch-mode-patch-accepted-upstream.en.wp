I didn't spend a month on that piece of code, but a few hours splitted over the last month. I had many discutions on IRC, worked on it, had comments on my patches, and finally the code should land in wayland/weston 1.3.


The commits:

<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston/commit/?id=ff39efa5c01eb51daf73593cd7a39cc3fac6d48e" target="_blank">first</a> one does massive renaming.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston/commit/?id=57388e44e5a8ddd01f44602d5d24514977f21bd1" target="_blank">second</a> one does the job</li>
</ul>

So now when a RDP client connects on the RDP compositor and its resolution does not match the desktop resolution, it's the desktop that adjust its size and no more the client.
