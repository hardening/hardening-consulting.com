This blog is written by David FORT. I am a passionate developer, my favorite subjects 
are security, network and graphics. I live in Rennes, France.

I have been working for software editors during the last 10 years, and always on security related subjects.

Iâ€™m an active contributor to open source projects like FreeRDP or wayland. I am a member 
of the core team of the FreeRDP and FreeRDS projects. I am also the official maintainer
of the RDP compositor (weston / wayland project).
