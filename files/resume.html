					<h4>Independant consultant - <a href='http://hardening-consulting.com'>Hardening consulting</a></h4>
					<h5>November 2013 - today</h5>
					<p>I've worked for various companies located in France, Italy, Poland and Austria, mostly on projects related to FreeRDP, wayland and Qt:
					<ul class='list'> 
						<li>I've worked on a project aiming to write an opensource RDP server using FreeRDP, it
						supports sound, disk redirection, multitouch devices, multiple monitors, remoteFx, H264, shadowing. It allows
						to connect on a X session or to display Qt applications directly. It is currently used in 5000 shops. This project
						made me modify and improve sources of FreeRDP, Xorg, openH264, Qt, wayland/weston, kwin and pulseaudio.
						This project should be open sourced mid-2017.</li>
						
						<li>I've worked on improving H264 performances in FreeRDP by using hardware acceleration. This
						project lead me to play with ffmpeg, VAAPI and the H264 format.</li>
						
						<li>I've also been hired as a RDP expert for a product that records RDP sessions, providing
						technical advises, bug corrections and evolutions.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h4>IPdiva - Software engineer then CTO</h4>
					<h5>November 2006 - November 2013, Rennes, France</h5>
					<p>IPdiva was the French leader for SSL VPN softwares, it was building softwares to secure access to LAN resources.      
      The company lived for 10 years with about 200 customers (hospitals, industrials, administrations, IT operators, universities ...), it has been acquired by
      <a href='http://www.systancia.com'>Systancia</a> in 2014. <br/>
      Within this job:
	<ul class='list'>
          	<li>I am the product's leader and I have worked on all its components. 
          	The product is coded in C++ and python (Zope framework), the target operating systems are Linux, 
          	Window and MacOS. 
          	To work on the product the following skills are involved: network programming, 
          	some knowledge of network protocols (HTTP, MS-RPC, FTP, ActiveSync, WebDAV, RDP), cryptography (openSSL),
          	system integration (Linux, Apache2, Win32, ActiveX, Java applet), web programming (HTML, CSS, Javascript).
          	
          	</li>
		<li>The product must appear as secured so security must be a constant concern. Today there have been only 
		2 CVE targeting the product.</li>
          	<li>The product has high performance expectations, and I have worked on reducing performance bottle-necks :
          	diagnose performance issues (valgrind and jMeter) and make required modifications to fix them. 
          	During the product's lifetime, performances have increased constantly although many features were 
          	added in the same time.</li>
          	<li>I have designed and implemented the process from the sources to the final delivery (from subversion to a debian
          	 mirror archive). I have made a custom builder that can: build a delivery using multiple hosts,
          	 manage build dependencies, tag a full delivery (handles different SVN locations), 
          	 check package's changelogs, do partial builds (only a subset of the packages). 
          	 Using this tool, a maintenance release is delivered every 3 or 4 weeks.</li>
          	<li>I have also been involved in the design of production tools (updates site, ticket management,
          	 PKI automation tools, monitoring).</li>
          	<li>I have supervised at least one trainee per year.</li>
          	<li>I have provided technical support and consulting services to major corporate clients.</li>
        </ul></p>

					<h4>Software engineer - <a href="http://www.atosorigin.com">Atos Origin</a></h4>
					<h5>April 2005 - November 2006, Rennes, France</h5>
					<p>AtosOrigin is an IT services company, I have worked for various customers.
	 
	  <h6>For Orange Business Services(April 2006 - November 2006)</h6>
	  The project was to build a tool to automate the deployment of a JAVA web application. The application 
	  was written in PERL and involved technologies were Apache, JOnAS and Tomcat.
	  

	  <h6>For Orange (February 2006 - April 2006)</h6>
	  In this project we had to make some evolutions on a Jabber server component. I took part
	  in these evolutions. The component was queryable through SOAP requests and 
	  I have made a SWING application to test "by hand" all the available methods (JAVA, SOAP, SWING)
	  
	  <h6>For France Telecom R&amp;D (September 2005 - February 2006)</h6>
	  The project was to implement a multi-platform XMPP framework (the projet's name was MOSAIC). The
	  target platforms were: Windows, Linux, MacOs, WindowsCE and embedded Linux. I have worked on the
	  core components (Visual C++, gcc) and a sample multi-platform XMPP client (C++, Qt).	  
	  I have also been involved in performance optimisations for embedded targets (Linux, valgrind).
	  
  	  <h6>For SFR/Cegetel (April 2005 - September 2005)</h6>
	  This project was a configuration interface on the IVR for the CRM of SFR ("le 9" in French). 
	  This server is responsible for dispatching customer calls over the miscellaneous call centres. 
	  In peak hours, there could be up to 20 incoming calls per second, the daily traffic was around 300k calls.<br/>
	  
	  The goal was to implement a configuration interface to set the parameters of the voice application. The project was 
	  written in JAVA on a WebSphere application server, the project uses <a href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts</a>, JSP,
	  Javascript, <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, <a href="http://www.castor.org">Castor</a>, 
	  XML, XSD. Development has been done using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>.<br/>
	  The project was delivered on-time.</p>

  					<h4>Software engineer for a research project - <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/">IRISA</a> in the <a href="http://idsa.irisa.fr">IDsA</a> project</h4>
					<h5>November 2003 - December 2004, Rennes, France</h5>
					<p>This research project was to study the deployment impacts of DNSSEC. I have worked more
      	specifically on implementing key rollover in DNSSEC. The work has been done in collaboration with a PhD student.
      	We have co-written RFC drafts and papers that have been accepted in various conferences.<br/>
      
      On the coding part:
      <ul class='list'>
      	<li>I have maintained the <a href="http://idsa.irisa.fr">web site</a> of the project.</li>
      	<li>I have implemented <a href="http://idsa.irisa.fr/index.php?page=kro&lang=fr">KROd</a>: a daemon that automate key rollover 
	  between DNSSEC servers (C, BIND, DNSSEC).</li>
      	<li>I have also worked on <a href="http://idsa.irisa.fr/index.php?page=libsresolv&lang=en">libsresolv</a>, a tool
      		based on BIND toolkit to build a client DNSSEC validator (C, BIND, DNSSEC).</li>
      	<li>I have extended the <a href='http://www.wireshark.org/about.html'>wireshark</a> DNS dissector to decode DNSSEC records.</li>
      	<li>I have extended BIND to support the <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ipseckey-rr-11'>storage of IPSECKEY
	      </a> in DNS records.</li>
	<li>I have co-written "Algorithm for trusted key rollover" that was accepted for <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/icoin/icoin2005.html">ICOIN 2005</a> in Korea.</li>
	<li>Another article "GDS Resource Record: Generalization of the Delegation Signer Model" was accepted for <a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icn/icn2005-2.html#GuetteCF05">ICN'2005</a>.</li>
	<li>We have submitted an internet <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-guette-ds-generalization-00'>draft</a>. 
		I also have <a href="http://idsa.irisa.fr/index.php?page=gds&lang=en">implemented</a> it in BIND.</a>
      </ul></p>

  					<h4>Software engineer - Intranode</h4>
					<h5>March 2001 - May 2003, Rennes, France</h5>
					<p>Intranode was a software editor for a product that does automated security audits. The
      	company was also hosting the software as a service for clients. Intranode was integrated 
      	by Netasq in 2004.<br/>
      	
      	I was a member of the R&D team and I have work on building a security scanner from scratch. 
      	We have designed and implemented an expert system based architecture to drive security tests according
      	to the rules defined by security experts. The output of the audit was a report 
      	listing the vulnerabilities found on each scanned host.
     
      <ul class='list'>
      	<li>The software was highly scalable as the miscellaneous C++ components could be
      	distributed on many hosts, communicating in CORBA (ACE/TAO). The expert system was
      	written in Prolog with a C++ API. It was coded for a Linux system.</li>
      	<li>The information gathering part of a security audit is essential because the next steps
      	depend on what is found during this stage. I have worked on these security tests to make
      	them accurate in most situations (C, C++, packet manipulation).</li>
      	<li>In collaboration with the security watch unit, I have also worked on implementing specific security 
      	tests (C++)</li>
      	<li>This work has been patented as FR0204652: "proc&eacute;d&eacute; et dispositif d'un audit de s&eacute;curit&eacute; dans un 
      	r&eacute;seau de t&eacute;l&eacute;com, plateforme et syst&egrave;mes correspondants"</li>
